![Screenshot_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e5d2265-2f81-4676-8270-6d1479d6534b)


## 🚀 Overview

This project is a web application that detects whether a given text is **authored by a human** 🧑‍💻 or **generated by AI** 🤖. Built with **ReactJS** 🌐 for the frontend and **Python** 🐍 for the backend, it participates in the **Voight-Kampff Generative AI Authorship Verification 2024** challenge.

## 📚 Modules and Libraries

### Backend:

1. **Flask**:  
   - Lightweight web framework.  
   - Enables seamless API creation.  

2. **Flask-CORS**:  
   - Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for API requests.  

3. **PyTorch**:  
   - Powers GPT-2 model computations.  

4. **Transformers (Hugging Face)**:  
   - Loads the **GPT-2** model and tokenizer for text analysis.  

5. **Regular Expressions (re)**:  
   - Handles efficient text preprocessing.  

6. **OrderedDict**:  
   - Maintains result order for better readability.

## ⚙️ Algorithm and Use Case

### 🧮 Key Algorithms

1. **Perplexity**:  
   - Measures text predictability.  
   - Lower = Human-like.  
   - Higher = AI-like.  

2. **Burstiness**:  
   - Captures variation in text predictability across sentences.  
   - Higher values suggest AI-generated content.  

3. **Thresholds**:  
   - Perplexity < 60: AI-generated.  
   - 60 ≤ Perplexity < 80: Most likely AI.  
   - Perplexity ≥ 80: Human-written.  

### 🔗 Use Cases

- 📰 **Content Verification**: Verify if blogs, essays, or articles are AI-generated.  
- 🎓 **Academic Integrity**: Detect AI-written submissions.  
- 🌐 **Content Moderation**: Flag AI content in social media platforms.

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## 🌟 Usage

1. 🌐 Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.  
2. 📂 Upload two text files: one **human-written** 🧑‍💻 and one **AI-generated** 🤖.  
3. 🕵️‍♂️ Click **"Analyze"** to uncover the results:  
   - **Perplexity** and **Burstiness** scores.  
   - Final verdict: **Human or AI**?

## 📂 Data

- 📜 The dataset includes a diverse mix of **human-written** and **AI-generated** texts.  
- 📊 These texts are processed to compute metrics like:  
  - **Perplexity**: Predictability of the text.  
  - **Burstiness**: Variability across sentences.  

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- **Perplexity**:  
   - 📉 Lower = Likely Human.  
   - 📈 Higher = Likely AI.  

- **Burstiness**:  
   - 📊 Greater variation = More likely AI.  

These metrics work together to determine the text's origin with precision.
